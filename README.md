# DreamVoice: Text-guided Voice Conversion


## Introduction

DreamVoice is an innovative approach to voice conversion (VC) that leverages text-guided generation to create personalized and versatile voice experiences. 
Unlike traditional VC methods, which require a target recording during inference, DreamVoice introduces a more intuitive solution by allowing users to specify desired voice timbres through text prompts.

For more details, please check our InterSpeech paper: [DreamVoice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16314)  

## Demo

ðŸŽ§ Listen to examples and download our dataset on DreamVoice's [Homepage](https://research.myshell.ai/dreamvoice)

## Installation

Make sure you have `git-lfs` installed:
```
git lfs install
```
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```
git clone git@github.com:myshell-ai/DreamVoice.git
cd DreamVoice
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Gradio Demo

```
python gradio_demo.py
```

## API Usage

You can use the model with the following code:

- End-to-end mode (DreamVC)

```python
from dreamvoice import DreamVoice

# Initialize DreamVoice in end-to-end mode with CUDA device
dreamvoice = DreamVoice(mode='end2end', device='cuda')
# Provide the path to the content audio and generate the converted audio
gen_end2end, sr = dreamvoice.genvc('examples/test1.wav', prompt)
# Save the converted audio
dreamvoice.save_audio('gen_end2end.wav', gen_end2end, sr)

# Note: End-to-end mode does not support saving speaker embeddings
# To use a voice generated in end-to-end mode, switch back to plugin mode
# and extract the speaker embedding from the generated audio
# Switch back to plugin mode
dreamvoice = DreamVoice(mode='plugin', device='cuda')
# Load the speaker audio from the previously generated file
gen_end2end2, sr = dreamvoice.simplevc('examples/test2.wav', speaker_audio='gen_end2end.wav')
# Save the new converted audio
dreamvoice.save_audio('gen_end2end2.wav', gen_end2end2, sr)
```

- Plugin mode (DreamVG + DiffVC)

```python
from dreamvoice import DreamVoice

# Initialize DreamVoice in plugin mode with CUDA device
dreamvoice = DreamVoice(mode='plugin', device='cuda')
# Description of the target voice
prompt = 'young female voice, sounds young and cute'
# Provide the path to the content audio and generate the converted audio
gen_audio, sr = dreamvoice.genvc('examples/test1.wav', prompt)
# Save the converted audio
dreamvoice.save_audio('gen1.wav', gen_audio, sr)

# Save the speaker embedding if you like the generated voice
dreamvoice.save_spk_embed('voice_stash1.pt')
# Load the saved speaker embedding
dreamvoice.load_spk_embed('voice_stash1.pt')
# Use the saved speaker embedding for another audio sample
gen_audio2, sr = dreamvoice.simplevc('examples/test2.wav', use_spk_cache=True)
dreamvoice.save_audio('gen2.wav', gen_audio2, sr)
```

- One-shot Voice Conversion (DiffVC)

```python
from dreamvoice import DreamVoice

# Plugin mode can be used for traditional one-shot voice conversion
dreamvoice = DreamVoice(mode='plugin', device='cuda')
# Generate audio using traditional one-shot voice conversion
gen_tradition, sr = dreamvoice.simplevc('examples/test1.wav', speaker_audio='examples/speaker.wav')
# Save the converted audio
dreamvoice.save_audio('gen_tradition.wav', gen_tradition, sr)
```
